# Quiz-Game
It is a simple browser-based quiz game. There is a total of 5 questions, each question will have 4 options.

Upon answering all questions and clicking a Submit button,
it shows user the score, like â…˜ (4 correct and 1 incorrect).

**I am using vanilla JavaScript and HTML to create the quiz.**

**I am planning to add CSS in the future.**
Need to mark the incorrectly answered question in red and need to mark the correct answer in green.
