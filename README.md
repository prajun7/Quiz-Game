Create a simple browser based quiz game. There should be in total 5 questions, each question will have 4 choices. 
What will be the content of the questions is upto student’s choice. 
(The questions will be directly hardcoded inside the code)
Upon answering all questions and clicking a Submit button, the following should happen:
Show user score, like ⅘ (4 correct and 1 incorrect)
Mark the incorrectly answered question in red and also mark the correct answer (optional, good to have)


     Note: In the type radio, the name field in the input must be same for all the radio option for each question.
 If the name field is different than we will be able to select multiple options which is not what we want
 


**I am using vanilla JavaScript and HTML to create the quiz.**

**I am planning to add CSS in the future.**
